# Simple NFT Indexer

This is a basic app that uses the Alchemy SDK rigged to Alchemy's Enhanced APIs in order to display all of an address's ERC-721 tokens, including a call to any `image` attached to their metadata.

This app is based on Alchemy University week 6 sceleton project that requires implementing some functions.

Wallet integration, ENS support, little styling and some UI features were added.
